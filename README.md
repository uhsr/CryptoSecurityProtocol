# CryptoSecurityProtocol

## Description

Here is a unique technical description for a GitHub repository about Crypto:"A decentralized cryptocurrency wallet that utilizes homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to enable private transactions and asset shielding, while integrating with a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm for enhanced security and scalability."

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a software project about CryptoSecurityProtocol:
- [
- "Authenticates user identities using zero-knowledge proof protocols",
- "Encrypts data at rest and in transit with AES-256-GCM and TLS 1.3",
- "Verifies transaction integrity with SHA-3 cryptographic hash functions",
- "Provides secure key management with hierarchical deterministic wallets",
- "Supports post-quantum cryptography with lattice-based key exchange",
- "Includes real-time threat detection with machine learning-based anomaly detection",
- "Enforces access control with attribute-based encryption and role-based access control"
- ]
## Installation

```bash
pip install cryptosecurityprotocol
```
